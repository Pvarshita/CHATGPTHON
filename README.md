In visual studio code, run the code(main1.py) and then we will get a GUI interface .Then give any command to the bot and then it will respond accordingly or it will speak out according to the given command. You can ask stories, motivational quotes, recipes to the bot. It will give you the output both in text and speech. we can further extend our application by making it more automated and adding other topics to explore.

We use three csv files as data sets for training our bot. 
We used the libraries(need to be installed if not ipynb):
•	Csv
•	spaCy
•	pandas
•	numpy
•	tkinter
•	pyttsx3
•	translate
•	random
